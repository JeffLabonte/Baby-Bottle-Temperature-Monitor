# Baby-Bottle-Temperature-Monitor

## Context

After the birth of my child, I wanted to make it easier to make the formula for my child. The water that you use for formula has to be sterilized. It means that you need to boil the water and wait for it to cool down to room temperature.

My wife and I noticed that the formula is easier to dilute when the water is above 30 degrees Celsius. I wanted to make diluting the formula brainless, this is why I created this project.

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 4
  * Raspberry Pi 3 should work as well
* [DS18B20 temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B094FKQ9BS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
