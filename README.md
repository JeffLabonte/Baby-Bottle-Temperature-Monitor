# Baby-Bottle-Temperature-Monitor

## Context

My first botn couldn't be breastfed so we had to use milk powder formula.

It is recommended to sterilize the water you use to reconstitute de powder milk.

We noticed that it was easier to reconstitute thr milk while the water temperature is around 30 degrees Celcius hence the limit at 30

## Hardware

  * Raspberry Pi 3 should work as well
